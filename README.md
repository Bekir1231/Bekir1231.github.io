Hi, I am Bekir. Itâ€™s my second semester at Wake Tech. I am in the Cyber Security program.
I think academic integrity is important for both professors and students so everyone can be judged by their own work.
# About Me

## My Interests
When I can, I like to ride my bike. It's a fantastic way to get outside. In addition, I enjoy creating my own music and listening music. I spend a lot of time with my buddies. One of my favorite things to do is hang out with them.
